<p>Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he
can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He
starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one
character at a time.</p>
<p>An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing
parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.</p>
<p>The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will
never find the top or bottom floors.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(()) and ()() both result in floor 0.</li>
  <li>((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.</li>
  <li>))((((( also results in floor 3.</li>
  <li>()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).</li>
  <li>))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.</li>
</ul>
<p>To <em>what floor</em> do the instructions take Santa?</p>
<input id="first" type="button" value="Answer" onclick="loadFile()">
<div id="main"></div>
<p>Now, given the same instructions, find the <em>position</em> of the first
character that causes him to enter the basement (floor -1). The first character
in the instructions has position 1, the second character has position 2, and so
on.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>) causes him to enter the basement at character position 1.</li>
  <li>()()) causes him to enter the basement at character position 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the <em>position</em> of the character that causes Santa to first
enter the basement?</p>
<input id="second" type="button" value="Answer" onclick="computeFile()">
<div id="basement"></div>
